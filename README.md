# LearningLog
Keeping a record of my independent learning since completing High School incase I need to reference it in the future. 

**During High School**
-Took most of CS50x but shifted to CS50p because I was struggling to figure out the python week of CS50x without outside assistance
-Completed CS50p in full including final project which was about importing and manipulating a dataset of Cross Country runners and their PR's from my high school team
-Tried a decent amount of problems on Leetcode to challenge myself with data structures/algorithms eventhough I don't know much more than the basics
-Completed a few basic projects like IOS calculator replica on websites like Codepen.io getting inspiration from github repos with project based learning ideas
-Completed CS50 Cybersecurity except for the final project to gain basic knowledge of cybersecurity like hashing, social engineering, vulnerabilities, attacks, etc
-Further learning cybersecurity topics and skills via TryHackMe and did some experimenting with other Operating Systems and VMs via Kali Linux on Virtual Box
-Watched entirety of Professor Messor Security+ training videos for CompTia Security+ 701 exam to learn about cyber and studied intensively with online resources but didn't take exam
-Skills aquired: Python, Java, basic HTML/CSS/JS, general cybersecurity knowledge, navigational github knowledge


**Summer 2025**
-Started CS50r to expose myself to a different kind of language than what I've already seen and also to learn basics of data science
